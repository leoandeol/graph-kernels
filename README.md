# graph-kernels
First Master Thesis on the topic of Graph Kernels and SVMs for Pattern recognition, focusing on low-complexity kernels for labelled graphs using random walks

Libs : libsvm (through sklearn) + networkx

Todo :
- [X] master the state of the art
- [X] write a graph generator (5/6 topologies) with labels with a seed
- [X] write a perturbation function
- [X] write an export function to create a db
- [X] write a metric
- [X] implement the state-of-the-art kernels
- [X] randomize them
- [X] either accelerate random walk kernel or propose a new approach
