# graph-kernels
First Master Thesis on the topic of Graph Kernels and SVMs for Pattern recognition, focusing on low-complexity algorithms for labelled graphs

Libs : libsvm + networkx (?)

Todo :
- [ ] master the state of the art
- [ ] write a graph generator (5/6 topologies) with labels with a seed
- [ ] write a perturbation function
- [ ] write an export function to create a db
- [ ] write a metric
- [ ] implement the state-of-the-art kernels
- [ ] randomize them
- [ ] either accelerate random walk kernel or propose a new approach
